              <h3> What really define me as Charlotte</h3>
               <p> I am Charlotte Phelip, 19yrs old from Paris and currently living in Lille 🌧 while studying at IESEG School of Management. Alongside my courses I love <strong>climbing</strong>, reading and travelling.</p>

               <h3> Learning by reading 📚 </i></h3>
               <p>Wether it be in english or in french, I read a lot to aknowledge vocab and grammar skills. My favorite book is : </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> written by John F. Fitzgerald (1925) </li>
                  </ul>
               <p>Reading is so underratted among my generation. Most prefer a night out to have a good moment, but reading can do it x10000 because it boosts your creativity</p>

               <h3> My favorite trips </h3>
               <p>Thanks to my parent I discovered the world and expand my mind to other cultures by travelling. My favorite trip is the one in Morocco 🇲🇦. It was so mind-blowing and an unexpected experience. </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="sport">
               <h3>Sport one of the biggest chapter of my life</h3>
               <p>Ever since I am a child I had to chill out and sport helped me. I practice gymnastic 🤸‍♀️, dance 💃, boxing 🥊, ice-skating ⛸, golf ⛳️ and tennis🎾 during severals years. I learned a lot from all of those, especially <strong>resilience</strong> and determination toward a specific goal.

               But only one sport change my life, climbing 🧗‍♀️. I  even went to Kalymnos, Greece to climb cliffs. I can resume my 5 yrs-experience as "keep climbing because the top of one mountain is the buttom of the next", like in life 😎 </p>
